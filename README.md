## Description

Climate Change Map (CCM) is a typescript solo project of drawing a climate change world map using React for the front-end and NestJs for the back-end. </br>
As the world's temperature has been constantly increasing these days and international authorities keep warning about the devastating impacts of the consequences, I have built a web application that shows how each country's average temperature has changed by a linear graph.

## Environment
